This repository has been build to 
 and store the simulations developed in the framework of 
![COMFOR-SUDOE project](https://github.com/IUFOR-selvicultura/COMFOR.NFI/blob/main/logos/)

funded by EU program.

This simulations have been made in Silviculture Group of 
![iuFOR](https://github.com/IUFOR-selvicultura/COMFOR.NFI/blob/main/logos/.png)

with the simulator 
![SIMANFOR](https://github.com/IUFOR-selvicultura/COMFOR.NFI/blob/main/logos/sm4_ancho.png)

## CrossForest-simulations
simulations performed at Cal√©ndula HPC - scripts and notes

## Simulations with randomly generated plots
All plots has been randomly generated with an R script `PlotsGenerator.R` in which number of trees per plot, number of plots per file and average dimension of trees is predefined.

There are a set of 10 simulations, from sim001 to sim010, with a raising number of total plots.

## Simulations with NFI plots

After testing HPC and SIMANFOR performance, we run simulations with all possible plots from Spanish NFI with 5 different scenarios
