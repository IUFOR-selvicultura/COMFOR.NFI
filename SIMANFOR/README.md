# SIMANFOR simulations for COMFOR-SUDOE project


That folder contains:

- :floppy_disk: **data**: raw data for each SNFI already filtered for mixed plots, checkpoints, and the inputs that need SIMANFOR to perform simulations
- :computer: **scripts**: code to calculate minimum data needed by SIMANFOR and adapt the file format
- :pushpin: **results**: plot grouped results by mixture. The results of the simulations are too heavy and can be downloaded [here](https://uvaes-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/aitor_vazquez_veloso_uva_es/EizXE6VVvaJBjtQriwA34vUBSxMJILJmDK1S96i50rE79Q?e=KDZN95)
